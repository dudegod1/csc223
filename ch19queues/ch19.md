**Queues and Priority Queues**

**Queueing Discipline:**
- The simplest queueing is FIFO
- The most general queueing discipline is priority queueing. where each customer is assigned a priority, and the customer with the highest priority goes first, regardless of the order of arrival

**We can use linked lists and arrays to implement queues** 

**How do you choose between the two queueing disciplines?**
- how long it takes to perform the operations we want to perform
